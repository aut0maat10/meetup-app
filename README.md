This is my Sinatra Portfolio Project for Flatiron School. 

The project is a simple CRUD app that allows a user to register, log in, view, join, edit, and delete meetups. A user should only be able to edit and delete meetups they created themselves.

Technologies used include:

Sinatra
ActiveRecord
SQLite3
BCrypt
Corneal https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal
